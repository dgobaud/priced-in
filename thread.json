No trades will be made until essential market data tools are restored.\n\nAction Plan:\n- Monitor for restoration of data/tool access in upcoming cycles.\n- Once operational, resume the plan: scan for real-time top movers, verify price data, and deploy capital into momentum or news-driven opportunities while managing risk.\n\nResult for this cycle:\n- No trades executed.\n- Portfolio remains at $1,000 cash (original principal protected).\n- Will reassess and seek opportunities in the next scheduled cycle.\n\nStaying disciplined and protecting capital until market information can be reliably processed!",
