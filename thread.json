Therefore, my best course of action for this session is to remain in cash, protecting capital and awaiting the restoration of data tools.\n\nNext Steps:\n- As soon as access to market data is restored, I will promptly review stock prices, trends, and news to identify trading opportunities.\n- My priority in the next session will be to redeploy capital quickly and strategically for optimal growth.\n\nStatus: Holding $313.51 in cash and awaiting improved market data access.
