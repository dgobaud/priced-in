[2025-07-24T18:56:22.111Z] 🧠 1. We need to start by reviewing our current portfolio to see cash, holdings, and recent performance.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 2. After obtaining portfolio details, evaluate cash available and positions.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 3. Conduct market scan via web_search for today's top movers, news, and sectors with momentum (especially after-hours).
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 4. Identify 2-3 candidate tickers with strong momentum, reasonable liquidity, and catalysts.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 5. Retrieve current prices for those tickers to assess sizing.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 6. Decide whether to buy, sell, or hold existing positions based on performance and new opportunities.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 7. Execute trades while keeping risk management – avoid concentrating more than ~30% capital in one position and keep at least 20% cash reserve.
[2025-07-24T18:56:22.112Z] 🧠 8. Recalculate projected cash usage before placing any orders.

[2025-07-24T18:57:27.611Z] 🧠 1. We currently hold all cash ($10,000).
[2025-07-24T18:57:27.612Z] 🧠 6. Retrieve current prices for those tickers to plan position sizes (roughly $3k each, leaving $1k cash reserve).

[2025-07-24T19:00:41.981Z] 🧠 1. Decide to check current prices for NOW, TMO, NVDA to determine position sizing.
[2025-07-24T19:00:41.981Z] 🧠 2. Will allocate roughly $3000 to each; adjust based on share price and round to whole shares.
[2025-07-24T19:00:41.982Z] 🧠 3. Keep at least $1000 cash remain.
[2025-07-24T19:00:41.982Z] 🧠 4. Need to use get_stock_price for each ticker.

[2025-07-24T19:01:31.679Z] 🧠 1. Based on prices, invest:
   - NOW: 3 shares x 989.2 = $2,967.60
   - TMO: 6 shares x 478.14 = $2,868.84
   - NVDA: 17 shares x 173.355 = $2,947.04
   Total = $8,783.48 leaving ~$1,216.52 (12%) cash reserve.

[2025-07-24T19:01:31.680Z] 🧠 2. Positions diversified across software (NOW), life sciences (TMO), and semis/AI (NVDA).
[2025-07-24T19:01:31.680Z] 🧠 3. Risk looks manageable; each position < 30% capital.
[2025-07-24T19:01:31.680Z] 🧠 4. Execute buys now.

[2025-07-24T19:01:58.046Z] 🧠 1. We successfully purchased NOW, TMO, NVDA and have $1,223.19 cash (~12%).
[2025-07-24T19:01:58.046Z] 🧠 2. Portfolio diversified with three momentum plays post-earnings (NOW, TMO) and AI leader (NVDA).
[2025-07-24T19:01:58.046Z] 🧠 3. Next steps in future runs: monitor price action, consider scaling out on further strength or cutting losses if momentum fades.
[2025-07-24T19:01:58.046Z] 🧠 4. For now, hold positions and keep cash reserve for opportunities or risk management.

1. Bought 3 shares NOW @ $989.20 = $2,967.60  
2. Bought 6 shares TMO @ $477.03 = $2,862.18  
3. Bought 17 shares NVDA @ $173.36 = $2,947.04  

Cash remaining: $1,223.19 (≈12% of capital)  
Current holdings:
• NOW 3 sh  
• TMO 6 sh  
• NVDA 17 sh  

Rationale:
• ServiceNow (NOW): strong Q2 beat, guidance raise, +6.5 % after-hours momentum.  
• Thermo Fisher (TMO): 9 % regular-session gain on earnings; potential follow-through.  
• Nvidia (NVDA): AI sector leader, fresh upside after-hours.  

Each position <30 % of portfolio, leaving cash buffer for flexibility.  
Plan: monitor price action over the next sessions; take profits on sustained strength or cut losses if momentum fades, while scouting new opportunities with the remaining cash.

[2025-07-25T15:12:36.492Z] 🧠 1. It's the next run; need to review portfolio to see current market value and P/L.
[2025-07-25T15:12:36.492Z] 🧠 2. After portfolio view, get current stock prices for holdings (NOW, TMO, NVDA) to evaluate gain/loss relative to cost.
[2025-07-25T15:12:36.493Z] 🧠 3. Assess market conditions: search for intraday news/update on these tickers and other movers.
[2025-07-25T15:12:36.493Z] 🧠 4. Decide whether to trim or add positions, or enter new trades using cash.

[2025-07-25T15:12:36.493Z] 🧠 8. Search for new momentum names today (earnings beats etc.).

[2025-07-25T15:14:08.338Z] 🧠 1. NOW slightly down (~1.4%), small unrealized loss. Not alarming, still above stop threshold (>4%).
[2025-07-25T15:14:08.338Z] 🧠 2. TMO and NVDA slightly green (~0.5%), also minimal movement.
[2025-07-25T15:14:08.338Z] 🧠 3. Since none triggered exit criteria, consider holding to give trades time.
[2025-07-25T15:14:08.338Z] 🧠 4. Could use available $1223 to open new position if good opportunity exists today.

[2025-07-25T15:23:36.391Z] 🧠 2. Possibly buy small position with $400-500 if liquidity good.
[2025-07-25T15:23:36.392Z] 🧠 3. We'll need get_stock_price(ALNY).

[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 1. Our current positions roughly breakeven; letting them play out may yield further gains.
[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 2. Taking a marginal $326 ALNY position won't meaningfully impact portfolio; but increases diversification and uses some cash, leaving ~ $900. FDA approval may continue momentum near-term.
[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 3. Risk manageable; biotech though volatile, allocate 1 share.
[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 4. Do buy 1 share ALNY for $326.64.
[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 5. That leaves ~$896 cash (~9%), still acceptable reserve.
[2025-07-25T15:24:04.254Z] 🧠 6. Monitor ALNY closely in next run.
[2025-07-25T15:24:11.410Z] 💰 Purchased 1 shares of ALNY at $326.64 per share

[2025-07-25T15:24:16.302Z] 🧠 3. Plan: keep monitoring.
[2025-07-25T15:24:16.302Z] 🧠 4. No further trades this run.
[2025-07-25T15:24:23.622Z] 🎉 Agent finished: Trades executed this run:

• Bought 1 share ALNY @ $326.64 (FDA-expanded approval momentum)

Current portfolio
1. NOW 3 sh @ 989.20 (cost) – current 975.57 (-1.4%)
2. TMO 6 sh @ 477.03 – current 479.60 (+0.5%)
3. NVDA 17 sh @ 173.36 – current 173.99 (+0.4%)
4. ALNY 1 sh @ 326.64 – current 326.64 (new)
Cash reserve: $896.55 (~9% of portfolio)

Reasoning:
• Existing holdings essentially flat; no exit triggers hit.
• Added ALNY for catalyst-driven momentum after FDA label expansion; small size keeps risk low while adding upside exposure.
• Maintain nearly 10 % cash for flexibility and risk management.

Next steps:
– Continue monitoring earnings-driven momentum in NOW, TMO, NVDA.
– Watch ALNY’s follow-through; be ready to trim if biotech volatility spikes.
– Search for fresh catalysts/earnings beats in the next session to deploy remaining cash or rotate out of laggards.
