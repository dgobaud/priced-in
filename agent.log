Rationale:
• ServiceNow (NOW): strong Q2 beat, guidance raise, +6.5 % after-hours momentum.  
• Thermo Fisher (TMO): 9 % regular-session gain on earnings; potential follow-through.  
• Nvidia (NVDA): AI sector leader, fresh upside after-hours.  

Each position <30 % of portfolio, leaving cash buffer for flexibility.  
Plan: monitor price action over the next sessions; take profits on sustained strength or cut losses if momentum fades, while scouting new opportunities with the remaining cash.

Current portfolio
1. NOW 3 sh @ 989.20 (cost) – current 975.57 (-1.4%)
2. TMO 6 sh @ 477.03 – current 479.60 (+0.5%)
3. NVDA 17 sh @ 173.36 – current 173.99 (+0.4%)
4. ALNY 1 sh @ 326.64 – current 326.64 (new)
Cash reserve: $896.55 (~9% of portfolio)

Reasoning:
• Existing holdings essentially flat; no exit triggers hit.
• Added ALNY for catalyst-driven momentum after FDA label expansion; small size keeps risk low while adding upside exposure.
• Maintain nearly 10 % cash for flexibility and risk management.

Next steps:
– Continue monitoring earnings-driven momentum in NOW, TMO, NVDA.
– Watch ALNY’s follow-through; be ready to trim if biotech volatility spikes.
– Search for fresh catalysts/earnings beats in the next session to deploy remaining cash or rotate out of laggards.
