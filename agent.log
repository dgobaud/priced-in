Rationale:
• ServiceNow (NOW): strong Q2 beat, guidance raise, +6.5 % after-hours momentum.  
• Thermo Fisher (TMO): 9 % regular-session gain on earnings; potential follow-through.  
• Nvidia (NVDA): AI sector leader, fresh upside after-hours.  

Each position <30 % of portfolio, leaving cash buffer for flexibility.  
Plan: monitor price action over the next sessions; take profits on sustained strength or cut losses if momentum fades, while scouting new opportunities with the remaining cash.

Current portfolio
1. NOW 3 sh @ 989.20 (cost) – current 975.57 (-1.4%)
2. TMO 6 sh @ 477.03 – current 479.60 (+0.5%)
3. NVDA 17 sh @ 173.36 – current 173.99 (+0.4%)
4. ALNY 1 sh @ 326.64 – current 326.64 (new)
Cash reserve: $896.55 (~9% of portfolio)

Reasoning:
• Existing holdings essentially flat; no exit triggers hit.
• Added ALNY for catalyst-driven momentum after FDA label expansion; small size keeps risk low while adding upside exposure.
• Maintain nearly 10 % cash for flexibility and risk management.

Next steps:
– Continue monitoring earnings-driven momentum in NOW, TMO, NVDA.
– Watch ALNY’s follow-through; be ready to trim if biotech volatility spikes.
– Search for fresh catalysts/earnings beats in the next session to deploy remaining cash or rotate out of laggards.

[2025-07-28T13:39:30.628Z] 🧠 1. Holdings have limited movement; nothing triggers exit/trim/buy signals.
[2025-07-28T13:39:30.628Z] 🧠 2. Market top gainers are low-float microcaps with extremely high risk; not suitable.
[2025-07-28T13:39:30.628Z] 🧠 3. Nike upgrade pop moderate but risk/return not compelling with limited cash.

[2025-07-28T13:39:43.913Z] 🎉 Agent finished: Morning snapshot (9:33 AM ET)

Prices vs. cost:
• NOW 968.79 (cost 989.20)  –2.1 %  
• TMO 478.32 (cost 477.03)  +0.3 %  
• NVDA 173.50 (cost 173.36) +0.1 %  
• ALNY 328.81 (cost 326.64) +0.7 %  
Cash: $896.55

Market scan:
• Pre-market strength led by Nike (+4 % on JPMorgan upgrade) and Tesla (+2 % on Samsung chip deal).  
• High-volatility micro-caps (VAPE, CELC, etc., +75 – 500 %) dominate the top-gainer list—outside our risk parameters.  
• No material negative headlines on current holdings; ServiceNow continues to receive bullish analyst coverage.

Decision:
• None of our positions breach risk thresholds (±5 % from entry).  
• No compelling large-cap catalysts justify deploying the remaining cash.  
• Micro-cap spikes are avoided to keep risk disciplined.

Action: No trades this run. We hold NOW, TMO, NVDA, ALNY and retain $896.55 (≈9 % cash) while waiting for clearer opportunities (e.g., this week’s major earnings releases).
